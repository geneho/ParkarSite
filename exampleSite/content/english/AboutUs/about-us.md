Parkar is built and maintained by 5 passionate millennials.

In the business domain, we have **M** spearheading our business direction and partnerships. **M** makes sure that while we are passionate about what we do, we are also doing it to allow Parkar to be here in the long run!

In the UI/UX domain, we have **C** painting the visuals and overall look and feel the app, making sure that the app looks good on everyone's device. **C** ensures that the app is innovative and immersive and most importantly,  brings positive sentiments to everyone.

In the tech domain, we have **J**, **H** and **G** breathing life into the app. Once the layout and feature details has been finalised, the tech guys will be the one developing the features and making it work!

Everyone has a role to play in **#TeamParkar** and we can't wait to show you what we have in store!

Finally, we hope that Parkar will bring about a better driving community for everyone in Singapore and to do that, it would be awesome if you can be part of it.
